# winamp/wacup yule logs to listenbrainz 

Small rust script to add winamp logged music to listenbrainz

## Usage

currently requires running local listenbrainz server, this will bet changed in the release

run the script with the first argument being the folder location of all the logs, the second being your listenbrainz token which the files will be submitted to.

## Later

maybe make it a direct plugin to winamp instead of just reading the log files
